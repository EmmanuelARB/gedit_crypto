===== What is this? =====

Crypto is a simple plugin for the Gedit
( http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/ ) editor, allowing you to quickly
encrypt/decrypt text documents.

Once installed and activated (through the "Preferences" window, "Plugin" tab),
it will add a submenu to the "File" menu, with two options allowing you to
encrypt or decrypt the currently open document.

Notice that to encrypt/decrypt, you should already have set up your key using
gpg or seahorse.

===== Technicalities =====

This plugin relies on the Seahorse ( https://projects.gnome.org/seahorse/ ) dbus
service, which does the real work.

===== Requirements =====

Gedit version 3 or later and Seahorse must be installed for the plugin to work.
