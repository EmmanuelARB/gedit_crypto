===== What is this? =====

Crypto is a simple plugin for the gedit
( http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/ ) editor, allowing you to quickly
encrypt/decrypt text documents with GPG.

Once installed and activated (through the "Preferences" window, "Plugin" tab),
it will add a submenu to the "Gear" menu, with two options allowing you to
encrypt or decrypt the currently open document.

Notice that to encrypt/decrypt, you should have already set up your key using
gpg or seahorse.

===== How to install? =====

If you are a user of Debian (or any derivative such as Ubuntu or Mint),
the simplest way is to download and install the .deb package above.

Otherwise, to install for a single user, extract the archive and then:

  cd gedit-plugin-crypto-*
  ln -s crypto.plugin ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/crypto.plugin
  ln -s crypto ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/crypto

To install systemwise (as root):

  cd gedit-plugin-crypto-*
  ln -s crypto.plugin /usr/lib/gedit/plugins/crypto.plugin
  ln -s crypto /usr/lib/gedit/plugins/crypto
  mkdir /usr/share/gedit/plugins/crypto
  ln -s crypto/crypto.glade /usr/share/gedit/plugins/crypto/crypto.glade

===== Technicalities =====

This plugin relies on the Seahorse ( https://projects.gnome.org/seahorse/ ) dbus
service, which does the real work.

===== Requirements =====

Gedit version 3 or later and the Seahorse daemon must be installed for the plugin to work.

In particular, current versions need gedit 3.12 or later; if you're using a previous version of gedit,
{{:gedit-crypto:gedit-plugin-crypto-0.3.tar.gz|download version 0.3 of gedit-crypto.}}

If your version of gedit is even older than 3.8, you need {{:gedit-crypto:gedit-plugin-crypto-0.2.tar.gz|version 0.2 of gedit-crypto.}}
