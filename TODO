Ideally, the plugin should be able to open .gpg files transparently, decrypting them on opening and re-encrypting them with the same key when saving.
It is not clear to me how to implement this. One option could be to set the buffer insensitive and replace the text in it when doing both operations. But decryption should be done _after_ opening, and encryption _before_ saving.
Also: can a plugin support a MIME type and/or commandline options?
